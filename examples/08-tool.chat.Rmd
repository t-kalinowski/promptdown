What is the current weather in new york?

# LLM

```{tool}
get_current_weather(location = "New York")
```

```{r}

<think> Okay, the user asked for the current weather in New York. I
called the get_current_weather function with location set to New York.
The response came back with a temperature of 65 and sunny conditions.
Now I need to present this information in a clear and friendly way. Let
me check if there are any other details I should include, but the
response only has temp and conditions. I'll format it into a sentence
that answers their question directly. Make sure to mention both the
temperature and the weather condition. Also, maybe add a polite closing
statement. Alright, that should cover it. </think>

The current weather in New York is 65Â°F with sunny conditions. ðŸŒž Let me
know if you need additional details!
